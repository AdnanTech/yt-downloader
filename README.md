# yt-downloader

Please make sure you download the correct Webdriver for your device. <br />
The default download directory is \...\...\dist\yt-downloader\data <br />
The default executable file is \...\...\dist\yt-downloader\yt-downloader.exe <br />
I suggest you make shortcuts of these, as it makes usability eaier.
